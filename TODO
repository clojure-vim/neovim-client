	[X] an we start writing tests for these things?
		[X] We'd have to start an nvim --embed, and maybe specify the NVIM_... ? 
		[X] Then, we connect
		[X] Test version validation
		[X] Integration test
			-insert some text in current buffer
			-command split the a new buffer put some stuff in it
			-command switch back to the original buffer
			-get the text of current buffer

		Tough to figure out exactly how to test against multiple version of
		Neovim's API. For now, let's just do this basic test, and document
		the version of Neovim used.

	Following the philosophy described above, we need
		[X] Make the user specify required API level on `connect`

		[_] Change the api to one function `exec`, pass the op as the first
		arg, and then use varargs, or a collection of args.
			Implementing `exec` and `exec-async` should include
			version-supported? check, maybe assume nvim_command will always
			be supported.

		[_] On `connect`, intern dynamically created functions similar to the
		macros we use now.

		[_] Change the existing samples to use this, maybe only support one
		sample.

		[_] Make a `doc` function that basically does `ns-publics`

		[_] Update the docs, including video?
			In terms of the docs, we'll take a similar approach that other
			AWS client libs have taken, we'll steer them heavily toward
			the *actual* docs, and using `nvim-get-api-info`.

		[_] Tag the existing version, bump the version (project & github),
		and release.

	Why aren't we doing anything statically?
		Although I'd prefer actual functions in source code, I don't like
			That I'd have to change code when they version the API
			But, more importantly, since the api_level supports a range of
			levels, I'd either
				have to support side-by-side versions
					but that would be easy with codegen & ns2, ns3, etc.
				make patches to all versions, if version by api-level
