TODO
	[_] Move this TODO to socket-repl-plugin
		[_] Move all of the socket repl stuff to a plugin project
	[X] Make buffer-get-text-async work, just test it at the repl
	[X] Get "eval-code" working
	[_] Figure out how to accumulate / display results in vim
		append it all to a file
		preferably a temp file (could be a lot of data)
		don't keep it in memory
		`:ShowRepl`
			no vimscript, invoke a plugin function
			show the contents of the temp file in the current buffer
			make it autoread
	[_] Name vim functions correctly
	[_] Pass host, port in connect

Goals
	-Not a proper nRepl plugin, primary use is as an thought exercise
	-Zero vimscript (plugin written in clojure)
	-Simplicity
		Ex:
			Don't modify behavior of stdio, stacktrace printing
			Append results to a "repl" buffer
		Code
			No nrepl (no request / response)
			No middleware
			No vimscript
			Clojure-only plugin
			All results displayed in one place
			One connection
	-Run repl side-by-side with editor
		Does not automatically start a repl
		Forces you to explicity connect
		One connection only `:call ConnectClojurePlugin(host, port)`
		Accessible from vim buffer `:call ShowClojurePluginRepl()`

Questions
	Figwheel cljs-repl support

Usage
	add command line args to your project, so it starts socket repl
	tell the plugin port (and host) to connect to

Debugging notes
	vim
		rpcrequest(1, ...) <-- use channel 1, w/ tcp
		don't do rpcstart
	clj
		connect! add localhost 7777
		vim blocks if you make a synchronous call to clj which makes a sync
		call back to vim -- use async!
